# Femettan die

Bought the game "femettan", a Swedish board game, but missed the "steps" die. This CLI is the perfect replacement. 

Just run the file and play, just as you would've had the die in your dear possession. 
As someone witty and wise once said: 

 - The generation of random numbers are too important to be left to change.
